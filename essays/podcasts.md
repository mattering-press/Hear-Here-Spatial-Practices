*Hear Here* is a site-responsive podcast series hosted by Nirmal Puwar. It is recorded in different parts of Coventry Cathedral, focusing on listening anew to the space. Guests bring their distinctive specialisms to the place. Collaborative fellowship is key to the art of dialogue and the art of listening. As a connector, a public academic facilitates an ecology of practices, focused on valuing the knowledge of the guests.

Spaces and archives are opened up, connected and enlivened through a variety of routes. Approached from the sidelines, in wayward directions, in-between the big frames and hanger narratives, a call-and-response of imaginations starts shifting our groundings. Conversations spiral towards an experimental index of the place, unfurling global planetary stories. Material archives are activated in the arts of contact zones, with generosity and care.
