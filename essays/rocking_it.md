A geologic, sociological and poetic collaboration of solidarity with the 100 million years old boulder from Bethlehem sitting in the modernist Coventry Cathedral.

"We approach the rock as a living research archive hovering in the air, between light and stone. Thus excavating an archive of materials and global stories connected to the very building of the cathedral.

The boulder travelled from Bethlehem to Coventry Cathedral in December 1960. It was moved along land and sea, through a collaborative "saga of goodwill", between Muslim, Jewish and Christian participants. The letterer/sculptor Ralph Beyer, an outsider/insider Jewish refugee from Germany, carved a scallop shell to make it a font."
