# Experimental Zine Index

Co-composed by Nirmal Puwar and George Kalivis, this Experimental Zine Index moves laterally, making zigzagging shifts between existing categories, helpful labels and unlabelled materials. Criss-crossing connections across boxes, loose newspapers, photographs and slide negatives lead to further questions and searches of stories out of the usual frame of references. An indexicality of relations layers collaged fragments of what is filed or yet to be filed. An arresting back-and-forth of correspondences threads a living archive, inviting a concertina of scattering searches inside and outside archival rooms. Searching for specific keywords provides an indication of the interconnected tapestry of multicultural experiments in the civic life of the cathedral from the 1960s onwards. The search terms knit webs of connections spreading across material archives.

# Trauma, Body and Home

*Trauma, Body and Home: An Affective Response to the 'House of Hope'* was created by Mahsa Alami Fariman (University College London), Ahmadreza Hakiminejad (Leeds Beckett University), and Heba N. Sabboubeh (Aston University) as an outcome of their research on the British Academy Innovation Fellowship project Multicultural Experiments in the Civic Life of a Cathedral, led by Professor Nirmal Puwar (Goldsmiths, University of London), and supported by the British Academy Innovation Fellowship Scheme and Coventry Cathedral. 

Hear more about the work of Mahsa Alami Fariman, Ahmadreza Hakiminejad, and Heba N. Sabboubeh in [their episode of the *Hear Here* podcast](/essays/fariman.md).
