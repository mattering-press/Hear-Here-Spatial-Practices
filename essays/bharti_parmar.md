# Introduction

Bharti Parmar arrived in Coventry in 1986 as a Fine Art student at Lanchester Polytechnic, graduating inside Coventry Cathedral. Thirty-five years later, she walks through different parts of the cathedral for the _Hear Here_ podcast. Bharti discusses both her artistic practice, as well as the architectural and artistic features of the cathedral, before closing the conversation in the needleworkers’ room, which sits on the lower ground floor under the nave, next to the archives room. Her attention to the elements and patterns of site-specific materials is interconnected with her own practice, as well as with broader histories of colonialism and radicalism in the city of Coventry.

Bharti’s conversation moves between textile production, political change and the Sutherland tapestry; botany, colonialism, and the Live and Dye Garden; the Plumb Line, cities, pennies in the floor as liminal points and the canopy as a threshold; as well as the needleworkers’ room with kneelers, women’s groups, stitches; bell ringing and the mathematical system; as well as embodied research as a fellowship.

Bharti’s closing words on fellowship foreground how the collaborations across the _Hear Here_ project have enabled the institution of different kinds of fellowship with specialists and knowledge makers from divergent and overlapping disciplines. A ‘homing desire’, as articulated by Avtar Brah (1996), emerges in the very habituation of the various locations in the cathedral, including the archives room, a space from which numerous fellowships have been forged and are yet to be developed.

A film with Bharti in the cathedral further supports the podcast discussion.

Bharti is an artist and academic with a focus on vernacular crafts and systems. She is an Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Art History, Curating and Visual Studies at the University of Birmingham. Her current studio-based research project, _Paper/Cotton/Plant_, focuses on the intersections between materiality, geography, and botany with a special focus on _The Herball, or, Generall historie of plantes_ _1597_ by botanist John Gerard (1545-1612).

She studied Fine Art Printmaking at the Royal College of Art (1992). Her doctorate, titled _A Grammar of Sentiment, Thinking about sentimental jewellery towards making new art about love and loss_, was on the poetics of Victorian material culture, particularly jewellery, mourning cloth, trade, and affect. Her artwork is represented in numerous institutional collections, including the Pitt Rivers Museum, the Crafts Council Collection, the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, and the Government Art Collection. She has undertaken several artists' residency programmes, including AIR at Light Work Media Center, Syracuse and at the Irish Museum of Modern Art.
