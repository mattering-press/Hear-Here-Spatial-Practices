## Introduction

Catherine Hahn brings her specialism in art, museums and space towards decolonising the weight of the space of the cathedral. She explores how space links to community, through different interventions and speculative ways of imagining what else could be instituted, especially with art. Masculinities and the art of the future are revisited and re-figured here. The speed of re-birth, experimentation, modernism and manufacture in the postwar energy of designing the cathedral and the planning of the city is situated. Catherine discusses how fragility can present the notion of ‘breathing cathedrals’ as moments for reconfiguring change. Catherine underlines how big spaces have big voices, which can take risks.

Catherine brings in two different modernist artists, Eva Frankfurther, who sketched labouring bodies and portraits with women and multicultural figures, taking us to what is behind the scenes in making spaces, as well as the colourist, Aubrey Williams (1926-1990), who created 30 paintings in response to Shostakovich’s music, providing a kinaesthesia of feeling music and colour, which could powerfully layer the cathedral. The discussion takes us towards denting narratives of erasure with interventions – such as _Noise of the Past_ – alongside call-and-response elements in re-shaping places. The steps of the cathedral are appreciated as a threshold with scope for planetary solidarities, a site from where different protest mobilisations regularly gather to sound out change.

The constant discomfort of reconciliation, reparation and representation presents challenges which move between Catherine’s research in South Africa and the UK. Linking us also back to the local, with reference to _The Pan-African Connection_ art exhibition (1983) at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, as well as the figurative work of both Claudette Johnson and Barbara Walker, to consider how intervention is received as well as resisted.

## Biography

Dr. Catherine Hahn is an artist and social researcher who is a member of the Migrant Futures Institute at Goldsmiths University. She uses creative research to identify obstacles to equality and to claim more equitable, life-affirming practices. She has lectured extensively, including in Art History at the University of Kent and Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths. She was recently the Administrator of Studio 3 Gallery at Kent and a researcher with the Global Gender and Cultures of Equality project (GlobalGRACE) at Goldsmiths. A key aspect of her methodology is drawing and mapping.  She is currently researching the diverse, working-class queer history of South London and is co-producing an exhibition with the LGBTQ+ Community Centre, Southwark (2025). The exhibition dovetails with research on local migration and leather. Catherine’s creative approach to history retrieval will challenge and change perceptions of South London heritage, including the local impact of migrants and colonialism. The innovative approach will resource future research collaborations with local archives, community centres and individuals.

Her publications include:

‘British History at Tate Britain post-Brexit: Rich, white men and space invaders’ (2025) _European Journal of Cultural Studies_; 'How to Do Social Research with Drawing’ (2024: 99-110) In _How to Do Social Research With..._; ‘Reclaiming History in the British Museum Entranceway: Imperialism, Patronage and Female, Queer and Black Legacies’ _Rethinking History: The Journal of Theory and Practice_, Taylor & Francis. She is currently co-authoring a book with Nirmal Puwar and Siobhan McGuirk, _Outsider Insiders: gender agendas and race in museums in the UK and South Africa_ (MUP).
