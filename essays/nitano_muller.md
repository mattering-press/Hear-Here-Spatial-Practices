## Introduction

Canon Nitano Muller discusses his landing in June 2024, in Coventry Cathedral, as Canon of Worship and Welcome. In the _Hear Here_ podcast he speaks from both the archives room and the pulpit in the nave. Archives now sit under his ambit, he imagines how archives can become the pulse of courageous global stories told and heard in the space of the cathedral. He views the archives and the layered interpretations of the cathedral, as part of the process of welcoming guests and visitors from all walks of life.

He was previously a part-time Chaplain to Archbishop Desmond Tutu, to whom he ministered before he passed away in 2021. This relationship has curated his thinking and theology around justice and reconciliation. Today he navigates a paradigm shift with racialised dynamics at an existential level as a black Canon, both within the cathedral, and amongst a global majority mixed congregation. He carries his embodied experience of apartheid South Africa, as well as black liberation, feminist and queer theology, towards reconciliation and justice.

Disrupting the somatic norm in church leadership within the UK, he reclaims the legacy of empire and British history, through the work of justice from Coventry Cathedral and the Cross of Nails mission. In the archives, Nitano looks back at hopeful images from the past for conducting multiculturalism, anti-racism and experiments in the earlier years of the new cathedral. He proposes that creatives practices need to reclaim untold stories and reclaim our imaginations, from the roof, the welcome desk, the pulpit, as well as the steps outside the cathedral.

## Biography

Nitano comes from the small fishing-community of Ocean View, located at the southern-most tip of the Cape Peninsula in South Africa. He completed a degree in Education and worked as a language and history teacher. While working as a teacher, Nitano was discerned for ordination to the priesthood in the Diocese of False Bay within the Anglican Church of Southern Africa and entered residential theological training at the College of the Transfiguration, Makhanda (formerly Grahamstown).

He served his curacies in two vastly different contexts, in Mitchells Plain on the Cape Flats, and Hermanus along the south-eastern coastline of False Bay (where he ministered to the Late Archbishop Desmond Tutu as a parishioner). Nitano served as the Diocesan Chaplain for Young People, a consultant for the Provincial Liturgical Committee, and a representative of his diocese on the South African Council of Churches (Western Cape). His passions include liturgy, youth development and the work of justice and reconciliation. In 2022, Nitano was selected as a Trinity Leadership Fellow, a program run by Trinity Wall Street, New York, for emerging faith leaders from across the world who seek to enhance their skills towards meaningful change and transformation in their respective fields and contexts.

Nitano's first encounter with Coventry Cathedral was its welcome sign posted at the West Screen entrance, which he says made him feel at home because he identified with many of the traits described in it.

[Coventry Cathedrals Welcome message](https://www.coventry.anglican.org/news/a-cathedral-welcome.php)

_We extend a special welcome to those who are single, married, divorced, widowed, straight, gay, confused, well-heeled or down-at-heel. We especially welcome wailing babies and excited toddlers._

_We welcome you whether you can sing like Pavarotti or just growl quietly to yourself. You’re welcome here if you’re just browsing, just woken up or just got out of prison. We don’t care if you’re more Christian than the Archbishop of Canterbury or haven’t been to church since Christmas 10 years ago._

_We extend a special welcome to those who are over 60 but not grown up yet and to teenagers who are growing up too fast. We welcome keep-fit moms, football dads, starving artists, tree huggers, latte sippers, vegetarians, junk food eaters. We welcome those who are in recovery or still addicted. We welcome you if you’re having problems, are down in the dumps or don’t like organised religion. We’re not that keen on it either._

_We offer welcome to those who think the Earth is flat, work too hard, don’t work, can’t spell, or are here because Granny is visiting and wanted to come to the cathedral. We welcome those who are inked, pierced, both or neither. We offer a special welcome to those who could use a prayer right now, had religion shoved down their throats as kids or got lost on the Ring Road and wound up here by mistake._

_We welcome pilgrims, tourists, seekers, doubters and you._
