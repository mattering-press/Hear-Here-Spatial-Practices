## Introduction

This podcast conversation started with an unexpected find by Freyja Perkins at the Welcome Desk of Coventry Cathedral, in a locked cupboard. A guidebook for blind guests to the cathedral, along with audio guides and mobile tactile models of the architecture, sat alongside a guidebook for staff to assist visitors. Once Freyja shared these materials with me, we were led to the box in the archives on ‘Cathedrals Through Touch and Hearing’, which was an initiative led by Professor John Hull from Birmingham University, who lost his sight during the course of his young life. In the archives we found the positive correspondence between Coventry Cathedral with Hull and his team, who pioneered the provision of tactile models and plans to assist blind visitors in places of worship. Freyja and I also found a model on wheels, sitting to the side of the nave.

As we sought to re-centre the visual aids, we made contact with Matthew Horspool, who was a regular tenor singer in the cathedral, blind from birth, super active and knowledgeable with braille and assistive technologies. For him the whole project ‘Cathedrals Through Touch and Hearing’, presented an opportunity to raise the profile of accessibility matters in the cathedral, as well as to acknowledge a vital aspect of blind history sitting in the cathedral. Several conversations took place between the three of us before the podcast, one of which included Canon Nitano Muller. After all, buy-in at the top of level of an organisation carries weight for any project aimed at making institutional changes.

The podcast begins at the Welcome desk, where Freyja first came across the materials, before we move to the model on wheels, tucked away on the sidelines of the nave. Thereafter the conversation takes place in the archives, where a selection of the correspondence is shared, alongside a discussion of how the project can be supported now and in the future.
