The reminder of bombardment and war loom in the reflections of the ruins through the west screen in the nave, as well as in the contemplative space of the ruins themselves. As Gaza was being repeatedly bombed, with continuous displacements and losses, demonstrations would regularly rally on the steps of the cathedral, in the threshold space between the ruins and the new architecture. I spent many days sitting at a desk in the archives under the nave of Coventry cathedral, starring at several shelves of uncatalogued materials consisting of books, newsletters, booklets, slides and audio cassettes.

A yellow Kodak square, with the label Al Shafar stuck on the side caught my vision. Having starred at it on several occasions, not knowing if I should be looking at it, one day I picked it up and opened it to find a carousel of 80 slides with a typed slide description; a script for a talk to accompany the slides. The materialisation of _House of Hope_, as formulated by Elias Jabbour in 1978, is partly captured in the slides, as well as in the correspondence with the cathedral, along with publications by Jabbour, who was connected to the Cross of Nails from Coventry Cathedral. Jabbour was a Palestinian Christian and Arab-Israeli citizen, he initiated the conceptual _House_ as an international peace centre in the Palestinian Arab town of Shefa-Amr in the Galilee region, which has been part of the Israeli state since 1948.

I invited two architects to engage with the slides, Mahsa Alami Fariman and Ahmadreza Hakiminejad, both of whom had curated an incredibly moving event in Coventry cathedral, with music, whistling, talks and singing, on ['_Woman_, _Life_, _Freedom_: The _Sounds_ of A Revolution'](https://darkmatter-hub.pubpub.org/pub/olzw3dms/release/4), on 20 May 2023. Grappling with what archives carry, as well as body as archive, they instantly connected the carousel of slides and the accompanying text, with the paintings of their architect artist friend Heba Sabboubeh from Palestine, who lives in Coventry. Approaching hope and despair together, Heba, Reza and Mahsa produced an art-book \[hosted on this website\], in response to the notion of _House of Hope_. This podcast is a discussion of their process of engagement.

Middle Eastern inter-generational trauma across time and space layers their responses to the box of slides, providing an alternative archive and alternative index to the archive. The podcast conversation picks up on how the House of Hope is one of _Despair_, laden with years of spatial and embodied inter-generational trauma in Palestine. Listening to the body as an archive, Heba connects the slides to vivid memories of plants, home, childhood, architecture, and the sound of military boots and stones. Heba discusses the buildings in her paintings, the figures of children and elder women who wait for returnees, whilst living in uncertainty. Grandmothers, children, paradise and destruction come together to re-situate dreams amongst the violence. The podcast discussion moves from the archives to the glass circular structure of the Chapel of Industry, where Heba reads a letter she wrote to her son from living under immediate curfew whilst pregnant.

Hope manifests in multiple configurations, in this site-specific conversation, the cathedral is envisioned as a radical space for political imagination; a utopian house of possibility and becoming; “a compass of mourning” as stated by Judith Butler, one that calls up the unachievable, requiring dreamers, poets and organisers. Architecture as a different and diverse space sits as a potential space for unlearning of orthodoxies in the special place of the cathedral.

**Dr Heba Nimer Sabboubeh** is a Palestinian architect, visual artist, and academic based at Aston University, UK. Her passion for art began in early childhood, eventually guiding her toward architecture; a field where she merges technical skill with artistic expression. Her artwork, known for bold lines and vibrant colours, conveys emotional depth, introspection, and quiet resistance. She has exhibited widely, including with the Palestinian Ministry of Culture, and held her first solo show in 2014 at Dar Zahran Heritage Building in Ramallah. Heba’s art explores themes of humanitarian struggle and social adversity, offering a poignant visual commentary on life, particularly within the Arab world. Alongside her artistic practice, she has contributed significantly to architectural projects in Palestine, working with organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, Catholic Relief Services, and the Ministry of Education. As a senior architect at Palestine Technical University, she led the design of key facilities, including the university’s sports complex. Her academic journey brought her to the UK, where she completed a MA and PhD in architecture. Prior to joining Aston, she taught architecture and the built environment at Bolton University and at Coventry University. Alongside her academic commitments, painting remains central to Heba’s life; a medium through which she continues to express resilience, resistance, and truth.

# Experimental index

*Trauma, Body and Home: An Affective Response to the 'House of Hope'* was created by Mahsa Alami Fariman (University College London), Ahmadreza Hakiminejad (Leeds Beckett University), and Heba N. Sabboubeh (Aston University) as an outcome of their research on the British Academy Innovation Fellowship project Multicultural Experiments in the Civic Life of a Cathedral, led by Professor Nirmal Puwar (Goldsmiths, University of London), and supported by the British Academy Innovation Fellowship Scheme and Coventry Cathedral.
