## Introduction

Holly Cooper brings to the podcast up to date research on Caribbean histories in Coventry, using storytelling and archival materials. Holly intervenes in how black histories are written, adopting radical black futurist methodologies into the writing and research practices. Holly situates parallels in community organising from the past towards the forging of inter-generational futures. The contact between elders and young people is a valued as a point of connection and knowledge creation, such as the annual event _Laugh and Chat_ held with grandparents. Holly’s extensive engagement with multiple archives -digital and local press archives – has created a cross analysis, built from visits to nine archives which do not have a digital catalogue. Interconnected black histories are organised in a spreadsheet catalogue by Holly spanning all the archives.

Holly shares the complexity of gaining legitimacy as an authorial voice when black historians undertake black history. What counts as history and who the somatic norm of a historian is expected to be, accompanies the challenges and joys of gathering stories vying for legitimacy in the face of erasure. Holly’s approach re-assembles the whiteness of archives via the notion of ‘negative assembly’, by working against the grain. Looking forward, Holly takes us back to festival Exodus 85, to imagine how this significant creative event in Coventry could be re-created for a 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary, by re-visiting the archives of this event currently sitting in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum.

At Coventry Cathedral, Canon Peter Berry is identified by Holly, from the sixties onwards, as an outspoken figure on anti-racism, who was also founder of the Community Relations Council. Locating him as a figure of privilege who was constantly working behind the scenes for justice, she hopes to return to him as a running thread in the manifestations of anti-racist initiatives, including for instance, the Coventry-Kingston Society. Holly flags up specific individuals and organisations with respect to social and political mobilisations, including Paul Stephenson who mentions Berry in his memoir. Lloyd Grant, another figure from Coventry, became the Secretary of the West Indian National Association. Holly also brings into the light feminist organisations, such as the Osaba Women’s Centre which opened in the 1980’s, with Viva Cummins as the first Development Officer.
