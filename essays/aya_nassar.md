## Introduction

Aya approaches the archive as an index of relations, full of absence, presence, promise, relaying all the relations that bring the archive into being. She situates the conversation within an expanded notion of the materiality of archives, cities and index; mentioning Sinan Antunâ€™s novel _Fihris_, which means Index in Arabic and published in English as _Book of Collateral Damage_ (2019). Our podcast conversation begins in the cathedral ruins, before moving to the Chapel of Industry, followed by the archives under the nave, before and finishing with a brief addendum on the wooden naval panel.

Moving between the different materials between Coventry and Cairo, Aya brings her geo-poetic analysis of materials, including dust and concrete, to the conversation. Both cities are approached as urban palimpsests: places layered with history, memory, and political relationships. Buildings of desire, attachment, promise and dis-attachment are replete within an atlas of emotions. Ayaâ€™s place-based, situated understanding of where we live, walk and conduct scholarship, channels our imagination to desires, and the planning of futures. Coming from Cairo, a city which is also strangled by the ring road, she leads us to look inside and beyond the cathedral. We hear of how Aya often thinks with and alongside artists to alter and expand our relationship to space.

Aya mentions how as an outsider to Coventry, she found several points of connection in the city, not always without frictions. When, for example, the far right was rioting in various locations across the UK, she walked to the cathedral, where a message of multicultural solidarity (relayed by Canon Mary Gregory) provided an holding space. Ayaâ€™s discussion of radical artistic politics, in a colonial context, takes us to the camouflage artist John Hutton, and the British military headquarters in Cairo.

Aya Nassar is an interdisciplinary scholar situated between politics, urban and political geography, and middle east studies. She writes about questions of memory, archiving, (geo)poetics of space, infrastructure and affective and material aspects of cities. Her doctoral research included investigating the archives of national Egyptian architects who were designing plans for post-colonial/post-independence Cairo. Her post-doctoral research focused on the aesthetics and poetics used to represent and depict Arab cities after 2011, neighbourhood storytelling and memory in Coventry, as well as space and memory work in Egypt. She is guided by postcolonial frameworks and inspired by decolonial and feminist approaches in teaching and research: <https://disembodiedterritories.com/Aya-Nassar>
