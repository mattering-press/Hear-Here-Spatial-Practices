The writer Monica Brown, whose father worked on building Coventry Cathedral, states in her visit to the cathedral for the *Hear Here* podcast: “I am here because dad was here”. Monica brings a journey of journeys to our dialogue, vividly relaying the strength and struggles of her family and the Windrush Generation, whilst moving back and forth between Jamaica and Leamington. Whilst opening the half empty pages of an embossed book in the cathedral archives, with the names of some of the builders who worked on the cathedral, the task of filling in the gaps of the empty weighted pages, gilded with gold leaf, appears as an open-ended process, bearing the weight of the past in the present. She closes with a call for an installation to recognise black and brown people, whose presence is absent and nowhere to be seen.

**Nirmal Puwar:** So hello Monica Brown.(...) Earlier on we were discussing how, you know, your whole education, and how it sort of forms your thinking so take us through what you've studied and what you work on now.(...) 

**Monica Brown:** So, in the beginning, in the beginning I was born in the UK in Birmingham but my first memory of life is Jamaica. My father came here in 1955 and immediately smelt the stench of racism, and realized that this hostile environment would not be one in which his children could thrive. And so, although I spent the first two and a half years of my life in Birmingham, my first memory of life is Kingston, Jamaica, where we lived for about a year and a half. But, my mother hadn't signed up to being married to my father to return to Jamaica without doing her nursing training, so at about four and a half I returned to the UK. So by the time I was five I'd clocked several thousand air miles. [laughs] Yes, and then we lived in Leamington between 1964 and 1972. And he insisted that he was going to use his skills and experience gained in the UK in nation-building, and so we returned to Jamaica by ship. So, I took a three-week journey, we took a three-week journey, my mother and my brothers and I took a three-week journey from the UK to Jamaica, via Vigo, Coruña, Tenerife, the Canary Islands, across the wicked Atlantic. And then to La Guara, Venezuela then to Trinidad and the last 1,000 miles to Jamaica. And it is in approaching Jamaica by ship, slowly, because before you approach the land a tugboat takes you. And you see the land emerging in the morning, and it makes you gasp and it made me understand with my European eyes why it is that the Caribbean was the reason that Europeans shed blood over that region. 

And so I went to, I did my first degree in Jamaica and this was a very interesting combination because I'd had the opportunity in Leamington Spa to learn French. And in the 1960s, my head teacher David Gay insisted that his state school, his state students learn French. And he and so we were the only school in the country in the 1960s who were taught French. And the passion for it remained with me. I had the opportunity when I was 10 to go with five other students from Warwick District to France for a month, when Leamington was twinned with Sceaux, S C E A U X. And the passion for the language and the love for the language remains, in fact I'm still in touch with my first French teacher, her name is Monique Gonta. She is 93 years old, she is suffering from vascular dementia. I met her last year in London for the first time in many years, and she said words which made me cry, she said, “I have forgotten many things about my life and my family, but I've never forgotten you”. And she has been an inspiration, so I kept my passion for the language through my life, O levels, A levels. And in my first degree, the combination was mass communication for radio with French language, and also literature. Literature in English and literature in French, so French literature, French African literature,  French Caribbean literature and literature in English. So that was the formation, then a career in national radio and television production, and academia - I taught media at university in Jamaica before returning 23 or four years ago, did my master's degree in media production, because of course the technology had changed. When I went to university in the late 70s and early 80s with my undergraduate degree, we were using reel-to-reel technology [laughs]. I remember carrying a (...) recording machine on my shoulder to do an interview, and it weighed 13 and a half pounds. And I was taught to edit using a chinagraph pencil and a blade, and, and then to stick the tapes together. Technology changed, I had to upgrade and I did that at the erm, Birmingham City University, that's why I did my master's in 2007. 

So, my life and work has, has encapsulated education, media, advocacy, writing, journalism, and training, coaching and training. I'm currently managing a project at the Warwickshaw County record office called ‘Telling Our Own Stories’, which is aimed at shining a light on the stories of communities whose stories have not been told. They've been ignored for racism and other reasons, their stories have not been told. And so, we are doing pioneering work engaging with communities, listening to them, asking them ‘how would you like your stories to be told?’, ‘how would you like your personal and your organizational community records to be documented at the Warwickshaw County record office?’. And that's what I'm currently engaged in, so this is what I'm currently bringing to the table.

**NP:** Thank you, that's incredible. I found you through Holly, the doctoral student, and I've already listened to your amazing talk with Leamington History Society, alongside your two brothers where you discuss your father's journey and then how you were all entangled with it. (...) and similarly at the Cathedral I'm trying to think of how can we center the figures who have just left on the side, they're in the shadows if you're lucky, that kind of absence-presence. And (...) often I'm going through the archives, I shared a few with you, photographs from the Lang archive, where there clearly are black workers, in a most obvious sense, but that there are no stories. There are no stories, you know, their families may be in the city. And that's when Holly said ‘you must speak to Monica’, because your father, Gersham?

**MB:** Gersham 

**NP:** (...) was also bringing his skills from Jamaica. And (...) he built a house there, he was a very skilled person, and he contributed to city building around us. 

**MB:** Absolutely. Two things, one: dad came here in 1955 when he was 25, as a fully blown, highly skilled man. And a man looking for opportunities to add value to himself. So, by the age of 19 he had built a house with his cousin. He had been taught carpentry, he had made furniture. I was looking at a tribute that his late sister wrote to him when he died in 1991, and she talked about him building her dolls houses. There is furniture in his family home that he built, tables and chairs that he built. And I remember, when he turned 21 in Jamaica he started to wear long trousers, because men couldn't afford to wear long trousers, it was more expensive. But he wore his first pair of long trousers when he was 21. Because at 21, he was engaged with a group of builders in Jamaica who were building bridges [laughs]. Who were building bridges, who were building roads. So this is a man who was involved, and so he could afford to buy long trousers. And long trousers in Jamaica at the time was an indication of some wealth, if you had a bicycle and long trousers [laughs] oh, you, you're on your way! So when he came here in 1955, he was clear about, he was fully formed. And if you look at a picture of dad, here, there's a picture of him at 25. 

**PW:** He’s got this hat on…

**MB:** The hat and the presentation, the jacket and the shoes, the seams, the seams on the trousers and the shoes. Just ready to work. And we have photographs in our family album in Jamaica of Dad standing on the scaffolding of this building with Coventry Cathedral in the background, because he helped to construct this Cathedral, and Coventry University. So…

**NP:** Can you say that again?

**MB:** We have photographs in our family album that I have seen, I can picture dad in that, in that dark blue cardigan, it may have had holes in [laughs]. I can, I can see Coventry Cathedral in the background. So we (...) he was bringing so much, and in addition to that and this is something that makes me marvel… So here's a man with four children, a wife and four children, determined to add value to himself. So he goes to work, he takes his flask, he takes his sandwiches wrapped in the Mother Pride bread, it was blue and white I can still see the striped blue and white Mother Pride, and the sandwiches were bacon or egg, and he would always add the picker pepper sauce to the sandwiches to give them some heat and flavor. but dad always
